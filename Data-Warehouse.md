# Data Warehouse

## Definition of Data Warehouse

- A data warehouse is an electronic system for storing information in a manner that is secure, reliable, easy to retrieve, and easy to manage.

- A data warehouse, also known as an enterprise data warehouse, is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence.
- A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile, time-variant collection of data in support of management decisions.<br><br>

## What is Data Warehouse?

- A data warehouse is the secure electronic storage of information by a business or other organization. The goal of a data warehouse is to create historical data that can be retrieved and analyzed to provide useful insight into the organization's operations.

- Data Warehouse is a big collection of data from small-small databases. Strategic information is stored in the data warehouse.

- A data warehouse is an information storage system for historical data that can be analyzed in numerous ways. Companies and other organizations draw on the data warehouse to gain insight into past performance and plan improvements to their operations.


## Example of Data Warehouse

- Consider a company that makes exercise equipment. Its best-seller is a stationary bicycle, and it is considering expanding its line and launching a new marketing campaign to support it.

- It goes to its data warehouse to understand its current customer better. It can find out whether its customers are predominantly women over 50 or men under 35. It can learn more about the retailers that have been most successful in selling their bikes, and where they're located. It might be able to access in-house survey results and find out what its past customers have liked and disliked about its products.

- All of this information helps the company to decide what kind of new model bicycles they want to build and how they will market and advertise them. It's hard information rather than seat-of-the-pants decision-making.

## Database vs. Data Warehouse  

- A data warehouse is not the same as a database.

- A database is a transactional system that monitors and updates real-time data in order to have only the most recent data available.

- A data warehouse is programmed to aggregate structured data over time.

- For example, a database might only have the most recent address of a customer, while a data warehouse might have all the addresses of the customer for the past 10 years.

## What Is ETL in a Data Warehouse?

- "ETL" stands for "extract, transform, and load." ETL is a data process that combines data from multiple sources into one single data storage unit, which is then loaded into a data warehouse or similar data system.



## Advantages of data warehouses

- Maintain data history, even if the source transaction systems do not.

- Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.

- Improve data quality, by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.

- Present the organization's information consistently.

- Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.

- Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the operational systems.

- Increase in the productivity of decision-makers


## Disadvantages of Data Warehousing

1. Underestimation of data loading resources

2. Hidden problems in source systems

3. Data homogenization

4. Creating and maintaining the warehouse is resource-heavy.

5. Input errors can damage the integrity of the information archived.

6. Use of multiple sources can cause inconsistencies in the data.
